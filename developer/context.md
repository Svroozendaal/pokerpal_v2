This file was imported from another application and no longer contains app-specific documentation for PokerPal.

PokerPal app-specific information lives near the code:
- Application map + doc index: `developer/APP_MAP.MD`
- Source tree map: `src/info_src.md`
- Auth flow: `src/contexts/info_auth.md`
- Skills: `src/skills/**/SKILL.md`
- Script behaviors: `scripts/info_scripts.md`

Behavior/workflow rules live in:
- `AGENTS.md`
- `developer/agents/*.MD`
