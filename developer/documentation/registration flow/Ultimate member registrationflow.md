This file was imported from another application (WordPress / Ultimate Member) and is not relevant for PokerPal.

PokerPal authentication documentation lives near the code:
- `src/contexts/info_auth.md`
- `src/skills/firebase-auth/SKILL.md`

If you are looking for access-control and sharing behavior (game links, private vs public reads), see:
- `src/skills/firestore-games/SKILL.md`
